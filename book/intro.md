# Welcome to the Open GLASSlab!

**Open GLASSlab** combines data sharing, research, and education in a collaborative space dedicated to the study and reuse of aged glass in construction. The main objective of Open GLASSlab is to support the circular use of glass by providing a central repository for strength data from across Europe, as well as an interactive **TeachBook** where users can learn and apply standardised post-processing methods. 

This platform allows users to analyse and interpret aged glass data in a consistent and standardised way, ensuring more reliable and comparable research outcomes. Whether you are a student, researcher, engineer, or industry professional, this **TeachBook** will guide you through the methods you can use to process the data, providing tools to support your work and enhance the reliability of your results.

## Motivation and Background

The reuse of aged glazing requires a thorough understanding of its surface quality and structural performance to ensure it can be safely integrated into new building applications. While research has shown that aged glass generally exhibits lower bending strength compared to new glass, it still holds considerable potential for reuse in specific applications where strength requirements can be met.

One of the major challenges in working with aged glass is the great variability in its strength, which is influenced by a range of factors such as glazing type, location, age, building use, and environmental conditions. On top of this unavoidable variability, the inconsistency in testing and data processing methods across different studies further complicates the ability to compare results and establish reliable, standardised design parameters for aged glass. This is a challenge that **Open GLASSlab** aims to address.

## Data Repository and Growth

To achieve its objective, Open GLASSlab aggregates strength data from across Europe and provides it in a central, publicly accessible repository: the **4TU.ResearchData**, where the Open GLASSlab collection is hosted ([DOI: 10.4121/fdaebd59-63ca-4439-81f5-93c7729a4d1c](https://doi.org/10.4121/fdaebd59-63ca-4439-81f5-93c7729a4d1c)).

As the repository grows with contributions from a wide range of studies, it will become an increasingly comprehensive, open-access resource for strength data. This will make it easier to explore the various factors influencing the strength of aged glazing.

## Open Interactive TeachBook

In addition to the data repository, **Open GLASSlab** offers this interactive **TeachBook** that provides guidance on commonly used post-processing methods for glass strength data. The methods are shared through interactive Python scripts, allowing users to process their data directly within the **TeachBook**.

You can use the click ðŸš€ `Live Code` button in the top right â€“ to activate the interactive features in the browser. Alternatively, users can download the Python scripts using the download button on the top right to work with their data locally, customising them as needed. This feature ensures that users have the tools to analyse and interpret the data in a standardised and consistent manner.

## Future Outlook

As an open-access resource, **Open GLASSlab** encourages the sharing, comparison, and analysis of data, providing a collaborative space where students, researchers, engineers, and industry professionals can contribute, refine, and expand the available knowledge. **Open GLASSlab** is currently under development and invites further contributions from the research and industry communities to help build a robust and comprehensive resource for the future of glass reuse.
