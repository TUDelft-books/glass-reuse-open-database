# Welcome to the Open GLASSlab!

**Open GLASSlab** combines data sharing, research, and education in a collaborative space dedicated to the study and reuse of aged glass in construction. The main objective of Open GLASSlab is to support the circular use of glass by providing a central repository for strength data from across Europe, as well as an interactive **TeachBook** where users can learn and apply standardised post-processing methods. 

This platform allows users to analyse and interpret aged glass data in a consistent and standardised way, ensuring more reliable and comparable research outcomes. Whether you are a student, researcher, engineer, or industry professional, this **TeachBook** will guide you through the methods you can use to process the data, providing tools to support your work and enhance the reliability of your results.
